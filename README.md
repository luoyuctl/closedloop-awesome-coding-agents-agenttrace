- **Wrapper:** No

## Qwen Code
- **CLI:** `qwen`
- **Remote Use:** Connects to Qwen-Coder models via various providers; runs locally
- **Specialization:** Qwen-optimized agent for refactoring and automating code tasks in large codebases
- **Wrapper:** Essentially a fork of Gemini CLI

## OpenCode (Archived)
- **CLI:** `opencode`
- **Remote Use:** Local TUI connecting to multiple model APIs; possible in headless environments
- **Specialization:** Multi-provider assistant with session management and LSP integration
- **Wrapper:** No – independent tool (now succeeded by Crush)

## LLXPRT Code
- **CLI:** `llxprt-code`
- **Remote Use:** Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, and local models
- **Specialization:** Flexibility to switch providers and models mid-session, themable interface
- **Wrapper:** Fork of Gemini CLI with added multi-provider features

## OpenAI Codex CLI
- **CLI:** `codex`
- **Remote Use:** Runs locally or on servers; supports ChatGPT login, API keys, or local endpoints
- **Specialization:** Executes code, edits files, and automates dev tasks with different autonomy modes
- **Wrapper:** No – official OpenAI tool

## Crush
- **CLI:** `crush`
- **Remote Use:** Works across OS terminals, including headless servers, using various model APIs
- **Specialization:** TUI with multi-model, multi-session support, LSP context, and MCP plugin system
- **Wrapper:** No – full application evolved from OpenCode

## Qodo Command
- **CLI:** `qodo`
- **Remote Use:** Local CLI interfacing with Qodo's backend; can run in CI for automated workflows
- **Specialization:** Framework for building specialized AI agents (code review, tests, docs, etc.)
- **Wrapper:** No

## Aider
- **CLI:** `aider`
- **Remote Use:** Runs locally with API keys; usable over SSH
- **Specialization:** Open-source pair programmer for editing code within git repositories
- **Wrapper:** No

## [agenttrace](https://github.com/luoyuctl/agenttrace)
- **CLI:** `agenttrace`

- **Specialization:** TUI for comparing agent cost, token usage, elapsed time, and slow-run diagnostics
- **Wrapper:** No

## GitHub Copilot
- **CLI/IDE:** IDE extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, and more
- **Remote Use:** Requires supported editor; works with cloud-based dev environments
- **Specialization:** AI code completion and inline suggestions
- **Wrapper:** No – GitHub service backed by OpenAI models

## Cursor
- **CLI/IDE:** Standalone AI-enhanced IDE (VS Code fork)
